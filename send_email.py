<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Have you noticed how many people got new phones over the holidays? ðŸ“±</p>

<p>There's a huge opportunity right now to turn those old devices into funding for your charity, and we handle everything.</p>

<p>Here's the deal:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your supporters mail in their old phones</li>
    <li>We handle all logistics and processing</li>
    <li>You get 50% of the proceeds (average $17K per campaign)</li>
    <li>Zero work required from your team</li>
</ul>

<p>We're only launching this with 10 select charities this quarter, as each campaign gets our full attention.</p>

<p>Want to grab a quick call to learn more? Just hit reply with "YES" and I'll send over a booking link.</p>

<p>Best,<br>Neil Fox<br>Founder, Donate by Mail<br><a href="https://www.donatebymail.org">donatebymail.org</a></p>
